# Gobra Action

This action adds Gobra to the CI Workflow of Go projects.

## Usage

See [action.yml](./action.yml)

## Examples

### Simple set-up without caching

```yaml
uses: viperproject/gobra-action@main
  with:
  	caching: 0
    javaXss: 64m
    globalTimeout: 1h
    packageTimeout: 10m
    projectLocation: go
```

### Set-up with caching

This configuration shows how to set-up the Gobra Action to store the verification results in  `${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/cache.json`. This file is loaded on subsequent runs of the Gobra Action and all cached verification results will not be  re-computed.

```yaml
- name: Cache Viper Server cache
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  env:
    cache-name: vs-cache
  with:
    path: ${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/cache.json 
    key: ${{ env.cache-name }}
- name: Verify all Gobra files
  uses: viperproject/gobra-action@main
  with:
    caching: 1
    viperBackend: VSWITHSILICON
```

### Storing artifacts

There are two artifacts generated by this Action that are worth to be stored:
 - the cache file, generated in `${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/cache.json`.
 - the statistics collected during verification,  generated in `${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/stats.json`. 

The following snippet shows how to store these files as artifacts:

```yaml
- name: Verify all Gobra files
  uses: viperproject/gobra-action@main
  with:
    caching: 1
    viperBackend: VSWITHSILICON
- name: Archive cache
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: cache
    path: ${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/cache.json
- name: Archive statistics report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: stats
    path: ${{ runner.workspace }}/.gobra/stats.json     

```
